        <P>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener,
            either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries
            or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the
            freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from
            forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is
            a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more
            malleable as its temperature increases.

            Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by
            the hands as finger food. Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an
            ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked items
            such as Baked Alaska.</p>

            Ice cream is primarily made from milk, and milk is full of vitamins and nutrients. 13 to be exact, including
            vitamin A, vitamin D, calcium, protein, and more!

            Your chosen ice cream flavor can add even more nutrients. Popular choices like all natural vanilla (not
            synthetic) and berries have antioxidants and dark chocolate has flavonoids which are good for your heart.

            There’s a reason everyone turns to ice cream after they’ve had a long day. It makes us happier! Whether
            you’re lactose intolerant, following a high protein or low carb diet, or restricting sugar content, everyone
            can enjoy ice cream.
